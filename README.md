# Secure Transaction Processing with Crypto

This C++ code demonstrates a secure transaction processing system using cryptographic techniques. It employs ZeroMQ for communication, OpenSSL for cryptography, and showcases storing, retrieving, and processing transactions.

## Features
- Defines a `Transaction` struct to hold transaction details.
- Provides functions to store and retrieve transactions locally.
- Implements RSA key pair generation and signature verification.
- Demonstrates AES encryption and decryption for transaction data.
- Utilizes ZeroMQ for communication setup.

## Installation
1. **Install Required Libraries**
    - Ensure that you have the ZeroMQ library and OpenSSL installed on your system.
    - For Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu), you can use the following commands:
      ```shell
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install libzmq3-dev libssl-dev
      ```

2. **Compile the Code**
    - Compile the code using a C++ compiler such as g++:
      ```shell
      g++ -o secure_transactions secure_transactions.cpp -lzmq -lssl -lcrypto
      ```

3. **Run the Code**
    - Execute the compiled binary to run the program:
      ```shell
      ./secure_transactions
      ```
    - The code will generate an RSA key pair, set up ZeroMQ communication, and process transactions. Note that placeholders exist for implementing cryptographic logic, transaction processing, and handling synchronization requests.

## Usage
1. Run the compiled executable (`secure_transactions`).
2. The program will generate an RSA key pair, establish ZeroMQ communication, and begin processing transactions.
3. Placeholder logic for cryptographic operations and transaction processing should be replaced with actual implementations for real-world use cases.

This code is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used for actual security-sensitive applications without extensive review and proper security measures.


## How It Works
Transaction Structure (struct Transaction): The code defines a Transaction structure to represent a transaction. It includes fields such as sender, receiver, amount, timestamp, and network addresses. This structure holds the essential information about a transaction.

Serialization and Deserialization (namespace Serialization): The code provides functions for serializing a Transaction object into a string format and deserializing a string back into a Transaction object. This allows transactions to be easily converted into a format that can be transmitted over the network and reconstructed at the receiving end.

Local Transaction Storage (store_transaction_locally): The store_transaction_locally function simulates storing a transaction securely. It serializes the transaction and can be adapted to store it in a secure database, file, or any other suitable storage mechanism.

Transaction Broadcasting (broadcast_restructure_instructions): This function creates a transaction and broadcasts it using ZeroMQ. This is a simplified representation of how transactions could be broadcasted to network participants for synchronization.

Transaction Handling (handle_restructure_instructions): This function handles received transactions and updates the local network configuration based on the information in the received transaction. In a real scenario, this could involve reconfiguring ZeroMQ connections or other network-related settings.

RSA Cryptography (namespace Crypto): The Crypto namespace includes functions for RSA key pair generation, RSA signature verification, RSA decryption, AES encryption, and AES decryption. These cryptographic operations provide security for transaction data, ensuring confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity.

Main Function (int main()): The main function sets up ZeroMQ communication, generates an RSA key pair, and begins processing incoming messages. It handles decrypting transactions, verifying their authenticity, and processing them as needed.

Use Cases
Financial Transactions: The primary use case is secure financial transactions. The code demonstrates how transactions can be securely processed, transmitted, and verified, making it suitable for applications like online banking, cryptocurrency transactions, and digital payments.

Supply Chain Management: The system can be adapted for secure tracking of goods along the supply chain. Each transaction could represent the movement of a product, and the network can ensure the integrity of data as it travels across different parties.

IoT Data Exchange: Internet of Things (IoT) devices can use this system to securely exchange data and transactions. For example, smart home devices could use the system to communicate securely with each other and external services.

Blockchain and Smart Contracts: This system could serve as a foundational component for implementing blockchain networks and smart contracts. It provides a framework for securely exchanging transactions and verifying their authenticity.

Secure Communication: Beyond transactions, the cryptographic capabilities of the code can be leveraged for any scenario requiring secure communication between parties, such as confidential messaging or sharing sensitive documents.

Distributed Systems: The code's communication and cryptography features are applicable in building distributed systems that require secure communication and coordination among multiple nodes or components.

Data Synchronization: The system's ability to handle synchronization requests can be useful for applications involving data synchronization across different locations or devices.












# Proof-of-Non-Tamper (Partially Deprecated)

Proof of Non-Tampering is a consensus algorithm concept whereby the ballooning ledger is replaced with more of a conduit style of propagation. The responsibility of the nodes is to keep a self-trimming record, as it were, of the validity or integrity of the network as a whole in more of a stateless way, the term stateless borrowed and modified slightly to define the network as carrying over the validity of the network as a whole as distinct from keeping a ballooning record. The network continuously self-trims but the validity of the information, stored both globally and in more detail inside of our ABI's, is guaranteed network-wide by tamper-evidence cryptography. So we perform a continuous integrity check on each new transaction while the private transactions, being not really anyone's business, remain private, verified, and containing the traditional ledger's information.

Future development plans include transposing this with existing internetwork ABI so as to permit mutating ABI's, which have some exciting prospects for internetwork EVM's. We have existing interoperability tech which I will incorporate soon to permit mass adoption of this consensus algorithm when it is finalized sometime after I am able to secure more funding.
